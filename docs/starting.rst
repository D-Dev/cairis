Starting CAIRIS
===============

You can use CAIRIS on any modern web browser.  To start using CAIRIS, visit the site hosting CAIRIS services, e.g. https://demo.cairis.org, and authenticate using the credentials you have, or selected when installing CAIRIS from sources.  For example, on https://demo.cairis.org, you can login with the username / password of test / test.  If you have installed CAIRIS from GitHub, you will need to also indicate the port that the CAIRIS server is listening on.  Unless you specify otherwise, cairisd will listen on port 7071 (i.e. http://myserver:7071) and mod_wsgi-express will listen on port 8000.
