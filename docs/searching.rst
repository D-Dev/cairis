Searching model objects
========================


It is possible to search for a requirement or any other model object with a particular text
string from the Search box in the menu bar.  Entering text will search the CAIRIS database and return a table of model elements where the text is present.  Clicking on the selected row in this table will open the associated model object.

Tags
====

Most objects in CAIRIS can be assigned one or more *tags* to help categorise them.  Tags can also be used to aid searching, i.e. by searching for objects where the tag has been set.

These tags can be entered in the Tags field in the appropriate form.  Multiple tags can be added by separate individual tags with commas.
