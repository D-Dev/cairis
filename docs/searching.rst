Tags
====

Most objects in CAIRIS can be assigned one or more *tags* to help categorise them.  Tags can also be used to aid searching, i.e. by searching for objects where the tag has been set.

These tags can be entered in the Tags field in the appropriate form.  Multiple tags can be added by separate individual tags with commas.
